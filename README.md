# hard-hangman

This is the original Hangman game where the user guesses letters one by one until they either solve the word or misses it in 6 tries.

There is an adaptation of a "hard" Hangman game where a letter in the word will be missing and there will be no visibility of the letter until the rest of the word is solved or there is failure.
